We show that the publication of Twitter data in\u001b[0m\u001b[94mconstruct posts that are treated by others as hateful and 2) how\u001b[0m\u001b[94mresearch raises significant questions for research ethics and that\u001b[0m\u001b[94musers construct responses to an opening post to perform\u001b[0m\u001b[94mas yet there is an absence of consensus in the field over how to\u001b[0m\u001b[94minteractional actions such as expressing agreement or\u001b[0m\u001b[94mresolve them. We argue that the challenges posed relate to\u001b[0m\u001b[94mdisagreement with it. To give a brief example, Figure 1 shows an\u001b[0m\u001b[94mfundamental ethical principles such as the minimisation of harm\u001b[0m\u001b[94mopening post tweeted by Katie Hopkins - a public figure in the\u001b[0m\u001b[94mand the value of informed consent.

Finally, there are also\u001b[0m\u001b[94moccasions where suggestions for good practice might be seen to\u001b[0m\u001b[94mcompromise academic integrity.

For researchers working within the European\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpresent composite or paraphrased data rather than publish actual\u001b[0m\u001b[94mUnion this reliance is clouded by Data Protection legislation\u001b[0m\u001b[94mtweets.

One editor told us:\u001b[0m\u001b[94mrequirement challenges standard academic practices of\u001b[0m\u001b[94manonymisation (although as already noted, this is hard to achieve\u001b[0m\u001b[94mMost journals would be reluctant to contemplate fabricated data.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mwith tweets in any case) and also conflicts with European\u001b[0m\u001b[94mThere are two reasons for this. The first is that it is not a good\u001b[0m\u001b[94mUnion11 and (in the UK) Information Commissioner's Office12\u001b[0m\u001b[94mproxy for the real thing.. The second is that it runs across all the\u001b[0m\u001b[94mregulations regarding the handling of data.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mcurrent concerns about research integrity and the potential for\u001b[0m\u001b[94mfalsifying findings. Making data available to reviewers but not\u001b[0m\u001b[94mOn account of Twitter's policy, it is standard to see tweets\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpublishing it would also run into problems with the open data\u001b[0m\u001b[94mreproduced in full in media articles. This creates an interesting\u001b[0m\u001b[94mmovement.. We accept that qualitative materials may be\u001b[0m\u001b[94mscenario in research dissemination in which we can link to a\u001b[0m\u001b[94mminimally edited for anonymity - see above- but we cannot\u001b[0m\u001b[94mnews item showing tweets in full but cannot be assured that\u001b[0m\u001b[94mcontemplate publishing papers that offer no opportunity for readers\u001b[0m\u001b[94mshowing those same tweets that we have perhaps collected via\u001b[0m\u001b[94mindependently to evaluate the interpretations and analyses offered\u001b[0m\u001b[94mthe API would be an acceptable practice.

We have seen various\u001b[0m\u001b[94mAs this respondent indicates, the reasons to be wary of\u001b[0m\u001b[94minstances of published journal articles that cover up usernames\u001b[0m\u001b[94mcomposite data on the basis of academic integrity are both\u001b[0m\u001b[94mand @handles [18] and have heard that journals will sometimes\u001b[0m\u001b[94mspecific to the type of analysis being undertaken and broadly\u001b[0m\u001b[94minsist on this practice where the content of the tweets is in some\u001b[0m\u001b[94mapplicable to research in general.

DISCUSSION\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpost would suggest a different analytic reading of it.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mThis paper has drawn on the outcomes of an ethics consultation\u001b[0m\u001b[94mto illustrate the challenges that arise when trying to determine\u001b[0m\u001b[94mIn broader terms we need to ask whether it is ever acceptable to\u001b[0m\u001b[94mwhat constitutes good practice in research involving the\u001b[0m\u001b[94mfabricate data in the publication of research. Even if done with\u001b[0m\u001b[94mcollection, analysis and publication of Twitter data. We have\u001b[0m\u001b[94mgenuine intentions this practice contradicts standard\u001b[0m\u001b[94mused our own project research as a starting point to investigate\u001b[0m\u001b[94munderstandings of academic integrity. For instance,\u001b[0m\u001b[94mthe\u001b[0m\u001b[94mthe ethical issues that require consideration when working in\u001b[0m\u001b[94m13\u001b[0m\u001b[94mUniversities UK Concordat to Support Research Integrity states\u001b[0m\u001b[94mthis area, particularly in the case of publishing specific tweets\u001b[0m\u001b[94mon page 17 that:\u001b[0m\u001b[94mwhen disseminating research findings. As illustrated in the\u001b[0m\u001b[94msections above, scoping the field has revealed a highly complex\u001b[0m\u001b[94m\"Research misconduct can take many forms, including:\u001b[0m\u001b[94mlandscape that presents major challenges for ongoing research.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mfabrication: making up results or other outputs (eg, artefacts) and\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpresenting them as if they were real\u001b[0m\u001b[94mWe have identified a lack of consensus in the field over the\u001b[0m\u001b[94mfalsification: manipulating research processes or changing or\u001b[0m\u001b[94mappropriate ways to collect and handle social media data and\u001b[0m\u001b[94momitting data without good cause\"\u001b[0m\u001b[94mprocedures through which to disseminate it. These differences\u001b[0m\u001b[94mexist across institutions, academic publishers and individuals.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mThe creation of composite data therefore creates a risk of being\u001b[0m\u001b[94mReliance on Twitter's Terms of Service to assume informed\u001b[0m\u001b[94mseen as research misconduct. We might counter this by stating\u001b[0m\u001b[94mconsent to collect data is standard in many studies but is\u001b[0m\u001b[94mthat the fabrication of posts would be done in a robust and\u001b[0m\u001b[94mproblematic. Direct approaches to users to seek consent (for\u001b[0m\u001b[94msystematic way - but how would we be able to judge this and\u001b[0m\u001b[94minstance to publish specific posts) can be achieved but are time\u001b[0m\u001b[94mwho would evaluate it?\u001b[0m\u001b[94mconsuming and, more fundamentally, do not necessarily\u001b[0m\u001b[94mguarantee that a user is capable of giving consent. Research\u001b[0m\u001b[94mIn our consultation other arguments have been raised around\u001b[0m\u001b[94musing Twitter data - in particular when the content of posts is in\u001b[0m\u001b[94mresearch integrity. As researchers we have a duty to examine\u001b[0m\u001b[94msome way sensitive - carries a risk of harm to participants. It is\u001b[0m\u001b[94mdifficult topics and social problems. The spread of hate speech on\u001b[0m\u001b[94mtherefore necessary to assess this risk when determining\u001b[0m\u001b[94msocial media can be seen as an instance of this. The prevalence\u001b[0m\u001b[94mprocedures for data handling and publication. Challenges arise\u001b[0m\u001b[94mand impact of hateful content is frequently reported in the news\u001b[0m\u001b[94mwhen we consider that Twitter is a dynamic platform: users will\u001b[0m\u001b[94mand the major platforms are often criticised for not doing enough\u001b[0m\u001b[94mcontinue to post after we have collected the posts that\u001b[0m\u001b[94mto stop it14. We might therefore argue that it is a priority for us\u001b[0m\u001b[94mparticularly interest us. If publishing drives audiences towards a\u001b[0m\u001b[94mto conduct research into these matters and share our results in a\u001b[0m\u001b[94mparticular user, their risk of harm relates to all their posts rather\u001b[0m\u001b[94msuitable way. This can help to identify solutions to the social\u001b[0m\u001b[94mthan just the posts we have published. Does that mean our risk\u001b[0m\u001b[94mproblem and perhaps hold platforms to account for their lack of\u001b[0m\u001b[94massessment needs to attend to previous posts and possible future\u001b[0m\u001b[94maction. However, it might be reasonable to assume that users\u001b[0m\u001b[94mones? As an open platform, standard practices of anonymisation\u001b[0m\u001b[94mposting extreme forms of hate speech would not give their\u001b[0m\u001b[94mdo not map well onto Twitter posts as it can be very easy to\u001b[0m\u001b[94mconsent to be involved in research - for purposes of data\u001b[0m\u001b[94midentify users by putting the content of their posts into the\u001b[0m\u001b[94mcollection and publication. Does this mean we cannot carry out\u001b[0m\u001b[94mplatform's search function. Furthermore, attempts at\u001b[0m\u001b[94mthe research? It is possible that requirements for informed\u001b[0m\u001b[94manonymisation are a breach of Twitter's User Development\u001b[0m\u001b[94mconsent might form a barrier to research being undertaken and\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpolicy. Twitter's requirements for data handing are also\u001b[0m\u001b[94mlead to researchers shying away from these important issues in\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpotentially incompatible with regulatory requirements and\u001b[0m\u001b[94mfavour of topics that are 'easier' to deal with in ethical terms.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mmedia practices for publishing posts frequently differ from\u001b[0m\u001b[94mAnother point is that justice for participants is also an ethical\u001b[0m\u001b[94macademic ones. Finally, the use of composite data in place of\u001b[0m\u001b[94mprinciple. It can be argued that those who have been made\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpublishing actual tweets is incompatible with certain analytic\u001b[0m\u001b[94mvictims of abuse on a public social media platform have a right\u001b[0m\u001b[94mapproaches and genuine questions arise over how ethical\u001b[0m\u001b[94mfor that abuse to be exposed in its original form. If we attempt to\u001b[0m\u001b[94mpractice can be balanced with the demands of academic integrity.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mparaphrase the content of the abuse or hide the identity of the\u001b[0m\u001b[94mIn particular, it could be argued that as researchers we have a\u001b[0m\u001b[94muser who posted it, could it be argued that we are doing a dis-\u001b[0m\u001b[94mduty to study difficult social problems such as the spread of hate\u001b[0m\u001b[94mservice to the victim of that abuse? Academic integrity is itself\u001b[0m\u001b[94mspeech on social media and that the creation of barriers to\u001b[0m\u001b[94man ethical issue and poses significant questions for work in this\u001b[0m\u001b[94maccessing and publishing data might lead us to neglect this duty\u001b[0m\u001b[94marea.\u001b[0m\u001b[94min favour of easier' topics.\u001b[0m\u001b[94mOur ethics consultation was not able to draw firm conclusions\u001b[0m\u001b[94mabout best practice with regard to publishing tweets and in\u001b[0m\u001b[94mrelation to the use of Twitter data more generally.
