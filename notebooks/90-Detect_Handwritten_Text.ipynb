    "I received your charming letter John and Sanford of the 8th.I heard there will be no more air mail letters sent, I don’t know but I am sending this one airmail on 10th so you can tell when it comes to send only telegrams and 3¢ stamps on letters from now on. I am well pleased with your fine letters, too bad that Ralph’s leave from Camp Ord was cancelled as we will have our hands full now to protect America from invasion. We have been called out on air raid alarms the last few days, but you know as much about what was happening as I do, the radio is the only dope we get as well as you about them Japs and nasty Germans. Bastards are what they are, raiding without warnings, sneaking up at night and such wrong methods of a clean fight. They don’t know how to fight clean. John, you must have had a swell time in Chicago shopping as well as seeing the sights – over Yes, I will be able to handle myself against those forces which try to sneak upon us. Ralph has not been away from home so long and the Films of both of us taken in L.A. are something to keep. John there’s always a chance for you anyplace you want to go. You are a good mechanic and they always need good men for defense jobs. Well John my part so far has been coast defense as San Diego is always close for invasion and we are all armed at all times for action at any place any time. I am well and healthy and feel just fine, smiling and enjoying the rain we just have had. Camp is now a lake and water and mud don’t mix. Thanks for your swell thoughts and I know we will all stick together in this war to the end. If you don’t hear from me -- don’t you worry. We can’t tell you when we leave, so if no mail comes you will have known I have been sent someplace. You can write me and I will receive your mail though. Dear Musha: Glad to know you are all right and always thinking of me as I am of all of you. I sent Sigie 20.00 M.O. on loan and hope he gets it safe. I thank you for the two dollars and tell you I am getting enough money now so please use it for home repairs and the hot water in the house for my little Musha needs such. Love and Keep Smiling – Frank. Dear Dad: Ain’t it the truth we study the war news over the radio and there’s 100 nations in this war. I hope you will keep up your good work at the factory and see that Musha takes things easy. Dear Sanford: So you spent 20.00 shopping and had a good time buying yourself things you wanted. Yes I will follow Elect. and always thinking of you and our baseball days together. I will say Sigie: Your letters are so good I have to read them over and over and always enjoy them. So when I send one it is always short and cold but your English has been much better than mine. We are now in the Barricks at Camp and has fine sleeping Quarters. We have a lot of rushing lately never knowing when we will get the call to leave. I am at present getting ready for chow so I must close with Happy Thoughts of you and the gang. As ever, your Sank, The Salesman Frank."

We have guard tonight and have had quite a few hikes to keep in condition. I can’t say much about the Island outside of that it is not so bad and has plenty of advantages for our protection. I went to church here at camp and enjoyed the outdoor sermon. We train to keep in shape and when they need us to do a job we will be ready. It’s good training here as all our fighting will be done in the same kind of islands. I have been going to some school on some valuable subjects. It looks like we are in a good way toward victory after destroying most of the Jap Navy and planes. If everything goes ok we will get leave by Christmas maybe. Musha, I know you will take care of yourself and not worry over anything. I really enjoy the island and as we are kept busy all the time we have quite a few books and movies to keep us happy. The football and baseball games and swimming. Always thinking of you and the boys. I hear the news every evening over radio."
